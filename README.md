This project is a web application built with Flutter for the front-end and Python for the back-end. The system allows users to upload documents containing address information. It uses PyMuPDF to extract text and search for keywords such as name, house number(No.), village (Moo), alley (Soi), road, subdistrict, district, province, and postal code â€” supporting both Thai and English. The back-end is implemented using FastAPI, and all extracted data is stored in MongoDB.
